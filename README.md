# 👋 Hey there, I’m Othmane El Mqiddem  a.k.a Kairos

🎓 **`Engineering Student @ ENSA Morocco`**  
💻 **`Networks & Telecommunications | Cybersecurity | Cloud |`**

I’m a Network and Security Engineering Student at ENSA Morocco, passionate about designing, securing, and optimizing communication systems. My interests lie at the intersection of computer networking, cybersecurity, where I aim to turn complex infrastructures into reliable and secure environments.

I have hands-on experience in Linux system administration, network configuration, and cyber defense technologies such as Wazuh, Suricata... I enjoy exploring how networks operate at every layer and how security principles can be applied to protect them against evolving threats.

I’m driven by curiosity, structure, and precision, always striving to build efficient, well-documented, and resilient systems. My goal is to grow into a Cybersecurity Engineer or Network Architect, contributing to the design and protection of robust digital infrastructures.
